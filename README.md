#Minimal Angular Application

This repository is about a minimal web application structure implemented with Angular framework, Material Design 
principles, Node.js and Express(for the support of html5mode). The basic rationale behind this 
structure is that every feature of the application will live inside a component folder. Each component will contain the 
functionality of a feature organised into different folders (controllers, templates, services, directives, models, 
etc.).
